# ðŸª´ Dom's Digital Garden

A place for me to publish my learnings as I dive into topics and document my active projects.

Because I couldn't bring myself to pay 20 dollars a month for Obsidian Publish, I have decided to use a modified version of [quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) based on [Brandon Boswell's Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITiiuBNVue0&t=364s) which has allowed me to host my own digital garden using GitHub Pages.

## Note to self
How to develop locally

nvm use 20

```
