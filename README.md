# ðŸª´ Dom's Digital Garden

Because I couldn't bring myself to pay 20 dollars a month for Obsidian Publish, I have decided to use a modified version of [quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) based on [Brandon Boswell's Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITiiuBNVue0&t=364s) which has allowed me to host my own digital garden using GitHub Pages.
