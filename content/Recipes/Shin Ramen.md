## My Favorite Instant Ramen

I really love the [Nongshim Shin Ramyun Black](https://a.co/d/0i5G8as) but after rooming with Garrett for 3 years, I have perfected my at home instant ramen to be just the way I like it.

## Ingredients

* 2 Cups of Water
* 1 Pack of [Shin Black Ramen](https://a.co/d/0i5G8as)
* 1 [Chinese Sausage](https://www.costco.com/kam-yen-jan-chinese-style-sausage%2C-21-oz.%2C-2-count--.product.100444318.html) (AKA: Kam Yen Jan)
* 2 Cloves of Garlic
* 1 Knob of Ginger
* 1 Tbsp of Peanut Butter
* 2 Tsp of Crushed Red Pepper
* 2 Green onions
* 2 Eggs

## Instructions

To start, boil 2 cups of water.

Next, mince your garlic, ginger.

Dice your [Chinese Sausage](https://www.costco.com/kam-yen-jan-chinese-style-sausage%2C-21-oz.%2C-2-count--.product.100444318.html) and slice your green onion into rings.

After the water is boiling, add the Ramen, Chinese Sausage, garlic, ginger, and soup packets. 

Additionally, I like to add in 1 Tbsp of peanut butter, 2 Tsp of crushed red pepper

Boil for 5-8 minutes, then crack two eggs and cover.

After about 2 minutes or when eggs are cooked with runny yolks, uncover serve. Add green onions for garnish.
