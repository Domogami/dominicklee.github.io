# How it went...

I decided to attempt to build a fully featured blog with blogposts that can be opened and read by users and edited by admins. I used S3 to host images and Editor.js to give me a notion like editing experience. I invested so much time into making this site that I never stopped to consider if this was really the best way to design it. Should I really make my primary blog editing exclusively on a website. Do I really want to use the Editor.js exported semi-json custom format to store my blogposts? What if I want a way to connect related notes together?

By the time I had built my blog, I realized that what I really wanted was a digital garden or second brain that connects my notes the way Obsidian does. I would rather have a "Blog Post" be a detailed markdown note that has quick links to other related notes. When I looked into how I can create such a garden, I found Obsidian Publish which would easily allow me to publish my Obsidian knowledge bank for $20 a month. When looking for alternatives, I came across Quartz which is the open source project that powers the website you are on right now.
