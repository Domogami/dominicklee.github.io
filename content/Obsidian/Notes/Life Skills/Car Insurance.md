# Insurance Questions for Kat to ask

* Can you requote the Personal Injury Protection (PIP)?
* Is "underinsured" the same as "uninsured?" Are they considered different?
* Can you explain what underinsured motorist property damage is? Is this covering damage to my own car if I am hit by an uninsured motorist? If so, requote at 7k max (the value of your car) and ask whether if instead of using the "underinsured motorist property damage" to cover this if I can instead use my own "collision" insurance? i.e. Can I use collision to cover my own vehicle if I get hit by an uninsured motorist?
* Can you requote the comprehensive insurance for $500 and $250 deductible? I just want to see the price difference. For $1000 it cost $82 a year according to the last progressive quote. I want to know if the price per year is like $95 or something cheap. If its cheap then we would be responsible for way less if your car gets vandalized for only a couple bucks more.
* Can you also requote collision at $500 to see the price difference?
* Can Rental Reimbursement be used toward a service like Gig where you rent a car yourself?
* Who is the Progressive roadside coverage through? Does Progressive do roadside assistance or is it contracted through anohter company? Could you provide more details on what that coverage includes and offer different quotes? Like towing for example, is towing XX miles covered? Is there a limit for how many miles towed there is? Does the coverage include a flat tire?
