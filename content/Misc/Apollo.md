# The Reddit App is Garbage

Its hard to appreciate what you have while you have it and you only start to miss it when it's gone. This happened to me with the Apollo app for Reddit. Luckily, all I needed to do was sideload was use this tool called Apollo Patcher which allows you to use your own Reddit API key and Imgur API key and bam, a fully working version of Apollo.

## Errors

First I ran into this error but it was easily resolved by deleting the existing app and sideloading again.

````
MismatchedApplicationIdentifierEntitlement (Upgrade's application-identifier entitlement string (KCBAXZFAK6.com.christianselig.Apollo.KCBAXZFAK6) does not match installed application's application-identifier string (XG3L8T56DK.com.christianselig.Apollo); rejecting upgrade.)
