## Basics

For a basic upgraded setup with a non-fiber plan, you will need a Modem that plugs into your Coax port, then a router that plugs into the modem. Additionally, you can add a firewall that plugs into the router that can help prevent against IP scanning and block malicious requests.

## Recommendations

Some of the recommendations I've received from someone who used to do IT Networking and someone who mastered in Networking are as follows:

* Ubiquit unify home network 
* Dream machine pro
* Purple Firewalla
