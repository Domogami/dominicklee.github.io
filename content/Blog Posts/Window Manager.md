title: Window Manager

## Yabai

I use a window manager called [Yabai](../Side%20Projects/Blog%20Redesign/Yabai.md) on my work computer and I have spoken highly of it in the past. I use a 2019 Intel MacBook Pro at my full time job which is prone to overheating and poor performance when running anything beyond IntelliJ. For this reason, I've found Yabai to be the most performant and best overall option despite it's shortcomings. Most notably, Yabai does not allow near-instant space switching without disabling SIP, which most certainly cannot be done on a work machine managed by an organization.

## Aerospace

I have recently switched to Aerospace as my window manager because of a YouTube recommendation from [Josean Martinez](https://www.youtube.com/@joseanmartinez) and [Ben Vallack](https://www.youtube.com/@BenVallack). I was excited for an alternative that was so similar to Yabai but praised for being better. I was intrigued by the accordion style window layout but was pleasantly surprised with how often I found myself using it. This is absolutely the best option that I have found so far and I definitely recommend Josean's tutorial for setup and feature walkthrough!
